This project is made for International MAIoT Challenge 2021.
This project is integrated with Google Spreadsheet and Glide Apps.

Brief project summary:
SPark is essentially a system that can be used to assist one in finding an empty roadside parking spot. SPark does that with the help of aerial CCTV cameras. Every parking space will have a pattern painted in the middle and will be recognized by the cameras. If a vehicle is parked on top of the pattern obstructing the recognition process, it will make the parking spot unavailable. This information can be retrieved by the user from the SPark mobile application thus navigating to other available spots. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a real time smart system that will update availability of empty parking space.
